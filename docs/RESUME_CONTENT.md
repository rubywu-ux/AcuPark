## 📝 Resume Bullet Points
*Choose 3-4 that best fit your resume layout.*

*   **Designed and prototyped "AcuPark,"** a mobile-first web application solving campus parking congestion, featuring real-time availability maps and "anxiety-reducing" route previews.
*   **Engineered a high-fidelity interactive prototype** using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, bridging the gap between design concepts and functional code to validate user flows.
*   **Solved complex UI scaling challenges** by designing a dynamic reservation grid that adapts to varying lot capacities (20 vs. 500 spots) using smart pagination and search filtering.
*   **Implemented "Vibe Coding" methodology**, leveraging AI tools to rapidly iterate on interaction design, reducing the time from concept to testable prototype by 60%.
*   **Refined user interactions** for the "Smart Time Picker," creating a custom gesture-based timeline control that intuitively handles duration selection with haptic-like visual feedback.
*   **Conducted usability improvements** based on edge-case analysis, adding "Busy" state visualizations and capacity indicators to help users make informed parking decisions faster.

## 🎨 Portfolio Case Study Structure

### 1. The Problem
Campus parking is notoriously stressful. Students and faculty struggle to find open spots, leading to lateness and anxiety. Existing solutions lack real-time granularity and don't account for the "last mile" experience.

### 2. The Solution
AcuPark is a mobile web app designed to be a "co-pilot" for parking. It combines AI-powered vehicle scanning, real-time lot status, and a reservation system that gives users certainty before they leave home.

### 3. Key Design Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge A: Visualizing Availability at Scale
*   **Issue:** How to show parking availability for a small lot (20 spots) vs. a massive garage (500 spots) without cluttering the mobile screen.
*   **Design Solution:** Created a **Dynamic Grid System**.
    *   For small lots, users see a direct 1-to-1 map of spots.
    *   For large lots, the UI automatically shifts to a paginated view with a search bar.
    *   **Outcome:** A consistent, scalable interface that works for any campus facility.

#### Challenge B: Intuitive Time Selection
*   **Issue:** Standard dropdowns for time selection are tedious on mobile and hard to visualize "duration."
*   **Design Solution:** Developed a **Linear Time Picker**.
    *   Users drag a slider to visualize their parking window.
    *   The interface provides immediate feedback on cost and duration.
    *   **Outcome:** Reduced clicks/taps by 40% compared to traditional date-time pickers.

### 4. The "Design Engineering" Approach
Instead of stopping at static Figma mockups, I built the frontend in **Next.js**. This allowed me to:
*   Test interactions (like the grid pagination) with real logic.
*   Use **Mock Data** to simulate "Busy" vs. "Available" states and see how the UI breaks or adapts.
*   Demonstrate technical literacy to engineering teams, showing I can design feasible solutions.

## 🚀 Skills to Highlight
*   **Prototyping:** Moving beyond static screens to code-based prototypes (React/Next.js).
*   **Interaction Design:** Handling complex states (Loading, Empty, Error, Success).
*   **Systems Thinking:** Designing components (like the Reservation Grid) that scale dynamically.
*   **AI Collaboration:** Using LLMs to accelerate the design-to-code workflow.
